    <h1> Weight in different planets </h1>
    <p> Weight depends on the planet you are and is defined as W = mg, where m
      is your mass and g is a gravitational constant, which depends on the
      distance you are from the center of mass of the planet and its mass. </p>

    <p> Given your mass, we can calculate your weight in different planets:
      Earth, Mars or Jupyter, for example. </p>
